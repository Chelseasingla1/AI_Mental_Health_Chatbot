# AI Mental Health Chatbot Repository

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the AI Mental Health Chatbot project! This repository contains a simple yet powerful chatbot designed to provide support and conversation for mental well-being. Built using the Langchain framework and the Ollama LLM, this chatbot offers a user-friendly interface and meaningful interactions, making it a helpful tool for anyone seeking mental health assistance. 🎧

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational Context**: The chatbot remembers conversation history, allowing for more coherent and context-aware responses.
- **Real-Time Interactions**: Engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot to get instant responses to your queries.
- **Easy to Use**: A straightforward command-line interface ensures that anyone can easily interact with the chatbot.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The chatbot uses the `OllamaLLM` model from Langchain and the `ChatPromptTemplate` to generate responses based on the conversation history. The conversation flow is managed within the `handle_conversation` function, which continually updates the context to maintain a natural dialogue.
